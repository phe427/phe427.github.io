# Question

How can Informatics help address the replication crisis?

# Summary

## What is the replication crisis in science?

*Replication* is defined as being able to reproduce the findings of a study with similar analysis methods, but with data generated by an outside laboratory. Many scientific studies, especially within the fields of social psychology, life sciences and clinical research, are unable to be replicated by researchers outside of the original lab. This lack of replication of studies is called the *replication crisis*. [^1]

The replication crisis has implications beyond research. If findings are overstated and they turn out to be non-replicable, this can result in a lack of trust from the general public in science. In addition, if the studies were badly designed or had small sample sizes, this is also a wasteful use of resources. [^1]

## Why did the replication crisis happen?

There are many reasons for the replication crisis. I will separate them out into the *statistical*, *experimental* and *cultural* reasons. 

*Cultural* reasons for the crisis include the pressure to publish in order to secure tenure-track positions. Many universities place a high priority for faculty to publish in prestige journals such as Nature and Cell. However, publishing in such journals requires publishing impactful results. This pressure to publish can cause researchers to overstate the significance of their findings, or in extreme cases, fabricate results. []

*Experimental* reasons include a lack of information about how experiments were conducted. There is a lot of information, or *metadata* about experiments, such as the date experiments were conducted, who conducted it, and other conditions that may not be communicated in short manuscripts. []

*Statistical* reasons for the replication crisis include the small sample size of studies, which can dramatically lower our ability to detect differences within groups in that study. [] Additionally, inappropriate statistical methods such as p-hacking (conducting many statistical tests and only reporting the positive ones) may have been conducted. []

I will now discuss informatics solutions to the *cultural* and *experimental* reasons to the replication crisis.

## Informatics solutions to the replication crisis

Many solutions to the replication crisis have to do with *metadata* and *open science*. Informatics approaches to replication include designing systems and workflows that collect metadata about experiments seamlessly, lessening the time researchers spend on these tasks. The required metadata for an experiment type is known as a *minimum information standard* and is now required for submitting the data to data repositories. []

Collection of metadata is part of the larger framework of *open science*, which emphasizes transparency in the scientific process. This transparency can be be within many aspects of the scientific method:

- Open Publication, where published research findings are available to everyone,
- Open Experimental Metadata and Protocols, where experimental methods are available,
- Open Software, where analyses methods are made publically available,
- Open Data, where researchers share the data with everyone.

Open software, also known as *Open Source* software, emphasizes the transparency of analysis methods by making the *source code* available. With *source code*, the methods of 

# Conclusions

Informatics approaches to the replication crisis are both social and technical.
